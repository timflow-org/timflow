Pumping tests
=============

This series of benchmark problems demonstrate the features and capabilities of TTim for
simulating and analyzing transient groundwater hydraulic problems such as pumping tests
and slug tests. More to come soon.


Confined Pumping Tests
----------------------

1. `Oude Korendijk`_ - One layer confined pumping test with two observation wells
2. `Grindley`_ - One layer confined pumping test with data from both observation well and pumping well.

Leaky Pumping Tests (Semi-confined)
-----------------------------------


1. `Dalem`_ - One layer, semi-confined aquifer test with four observation wells.
2. `Hardixveld`_ - Four layers (Aquitard - Aquifer - Aquitard - Aquifer) semi-confined pumping test with data from the pumping well.

Slug Tests
----------

1. `Pratt County`_ - One layer partially penetrated slug test with data from the test well.
2. `Falling Head`_ - One layer partially penetrated slug test with data from the test well.
