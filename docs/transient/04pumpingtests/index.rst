Pumping tests
=============

This series of benchmark problems demonstrate the features and capabilities of
``timflow.transient`` for simulating and analyzing transient groundwater hydraulic
problems such as pumping tests and slug tests. More to come soon.

Confined Pumping Tests
----------------------

1. :doc:`Oude Korendijk <confined1_oude_korendijk>` - One layer confined pumping test with two observation wells
2. :doc:`Grindley <confined2_grindley>` - One layer confined pumping test with data from both observation well and pumping well.

Leaky Pumping Tests (Semi-confined)
-----------------------------------

1. :doc:`Dalem <leaky1_dalem>` - One layer, semi-confined aquifer test with four observation wells.
2. :doc:`Hardixveld <leaky2_hardixveld>` - Four layers (Aquitard - Aquifer - Aquitard - Aquifer) semi-confined pumping test with data from the pumping well.

Slug Tests
----------

1. :doc:`Pratt County <slug1_pratt_county>` - One layer partially penetrated slug test with data from the test well.
2. :doc:`Falling Head <slug2_falling_head>` - One layer partially penetrated slug test with data from the test well.
