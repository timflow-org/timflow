Pumping tests
=============

This series of benchmark problems demonstrate the features and capabilities of
``timflow.transient`` for simulating and analyzing transient groundwater hydraulic
problems such as pumping tests and slug tests. More to come soon.

Confined Pumping Tests
----------------------

1. :doc:`Oude Korendijk <confined1_oude_korendijk>` - One layer confined pumping test with two observation wells
2. :doc:`Grindley <confined2_grindley>` - One layer confined pumping test with data from both observation well and pumping well.
3. :doc:`Sioux <confined3_sioux>` - One layer confined pumping test with three observation wells. 

Leaky Pumping Tests (Semi-confined)
-----------------------------------

1. :doc:`Dalem <leaky1_dalem>` - One layer, semi-confined aquifer test with four observation wells.
2. :doc:`Hardixveld <leaky2_hardixveld>` - Four layers (Aquitard - Aquifer - Aquitard - Aquifer) semi-confined pumping test with data from the pumping well.
3. :doc:`Texas Hill <leaky3_texashill>` - Two layers, semi-confined aquifer test with three observation wells. 

Slug Tests
----------

1. :doc:`Pratt County <slug1_pratt_county>` - Slug test with data from the partially penetrating test well.
2. :doc:`Multi well <slug2_multiwell>` - Slug test with data from both fully penetrating test well and observation well.
